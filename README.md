# Screenshot Test

This little application boots up, takes a screenshot of the desktop including its own window, saves it in either `C:\screenshots\desktop.png` or `/tmp/screenshots/desktop.png` depending on the OS, then closes.

# To Run

`yarn` to install everything, `yarn start` to run the test.
